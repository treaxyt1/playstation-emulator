        <p>Welcome to the most complete resource for PlayStation emulation on the web. Whether you're a long-time fan of
            the 32-bit era or a newcomer looking to experience the classics for the first time, this guide covers
            everything you need to know about the past, present, and future of PS1 emulation.</p>

        <h2>A Revolution in 32-Bits</h2>
        <p>The original PlayStation, released in late 1994, changed the gaming landscape forever. It was the first
            "mainstream" console to successfully transition from 2D sprites to immersive 3D polygonal environments. With
            titles like Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy VII, and Resident Evil, it established a library of games that
            are still celebrated as masterpieces today.</p>

        <h2>How Browser Emulation Works</h2>
        <p>In the past, emulating a PlayStation required high-performance PC hardware and complex plugins. Today, thanks
            to the power of <strong>WebAssembly (Wasm)</strong>, we can run high-fidelity emulators directly in the
            browser. WebAssembly allows code written in C++ (the language of most desktop emulators) to run at
            near-native speeds in a sandbox environment inside your browser window.</p>

        <h2>Legal Considerations & Ethics</h2>
        <p>Emulation is a legal technology used for preservation and archival research. However, downloading commercial
            BIOS files and game ROMs that you do not own is illegal in most jurisdictions. At PSX WebHub, we encourage
            the <strong>"Backup Ownership"</strong> model. This involves ripping the data from your original physical
            discs using a PC and then loading that digital file into our emulator.</p>

        <h2>Performance Optimization Tips</h2>
        <p>To get the best experience from PSX WebHub, consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardware Acceleration:</strong> Ensure your browser has access to your GPU. Check settings under
                System/Performance in Chrome or Edge.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Browser-based emulation can be RAM-intensive. Close unused tabs
                before launching complex games.</li>
            <li><strong>Input Lag:</strong> Using a wired controller (XInput or DualShock) provides lower latency than
                Bluetooth connections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Future of Retro Preservation</h2>
        <p>As original hardware failures become more common, digital emulation remains the only reliable way to preserve
            these cultural digital artifacts. By leveraging universal web standards, we ensure that these games remain
            playable regardless of the operating system or hardware profile of the future.</p>
