        <div class="article-content">
            <p>The original PlayStation (PS1) was a watershed moment in gaming history. Released in late 1994, it
                brought 3D polygonal graphics into the mainstream, creating iconic franchises that still dominate the
                industry today. But as the hardware ages and physical consoles fail, the burden of preservation falls
                onto software emulation. In 2026, we are witnessing a new frontier: the browser-based revolution.</p>

            <h2 id="history">1. The Evolution of PS1 Emulation</h2>
            <p>Emulating the PlayStation is no small feat. The console used a custom 32-bit MIPS R3000A RISC processor
                running at 33.8 MHz, paired with 2 MB of main RAM and 1 MB of video RAM. While those numbers seem tiny
                by modern standards, the complex architecture required high overhead to replicate in software.</p>
            <p>The early 2000s saw the rise of "Plugin-based" emulators like ePSXe. These required users to configure
                separate BIOS files, video drivers, and sound plugins. It was powerful but complex. Today, we move
                toward "All-in-one" solutions that prioritize accessibility. Projects like RetroArch pioneered the
                unified interface, but the ultimate accessibility is the web browser.</p>

            <h2 id="how-it-works">2. Core Technologies: Wasm & JS</h2>
            <p>How does a website like ePSXemu run a 3D console natively? The answer lies in <strong>WebAssembly
                    (Wasm)</strong>. This binary instruction format allows code written in high-performance languages
                like C++ to run in the browser at near-native speeds. By porting existing emulator cores to Wasm, we can
                achieve high-fidelity emulation without the user ever needing to install an executable.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Native Speeds:</strong> Wasm bypasses the performance bottlenecks of traditional JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Safe Sandboxing:</strong> Running in the browser provides a layer of security between the
                    game code and your OS.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> Since it's web-based, the same code runs on Windows, Mac, Linux,
                    and even Android.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="legality">3. Navigating the Legal Landscape</h2>
            <p>One of the most frequent questions we receive is: Is emulation legal? The short answer in most
                jurisdictions is yes—emulation as a technology is legal. However, the acquisition of BIOS files (the
                console's internal software) and ROMs (the games) is where things get complex. At ePSXemu, we advocate
                for the "Own-and-Dump" method. If you own the physical disc, you are legally entitled to create a
                digital backup for personal archival use.</p>

            <h2 id="optimization">4. Performance Tuning for Browsers</h2>
            <p>Even with WebAssembly, browser resources are limited. To get the best 60FPS experience, we recommend
                enabling <strong>Hardware Acceleration</strong> in your browser settings. This allows the emulator to
                leverage your computer's GPU for rendering polygons, rather than relying solely on the CPU. Furthermore,
                closing background tabs can significantly reduce frame jitter during complex cutscenes.</p>

            <h2 id="future">5. The Future of Retro Preservation</h2>
            <p>As we look toward the 2030s, the goal of projects like ePSXemu is to ensure that the culture of the 90s
                isn't lost to "bit rot." By making these games playable on any device with a screen and an internet
                connection, we democratize history. PlayStation's legacy is too important to be locked away in dusty
                attics; it deserves to be played, studied, and enjoyed by every new generation of gamers.</p>
